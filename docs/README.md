# Project webpage template

This project template was built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).


### Setup

You will need to install ruby and gem to use `jekyll` locally. This is only if you want to compile and run this site locally. If you want to modify a markdown file or a yaml file, you don't need to do that; please refer to the sections above for instructions.

For the instructions, see [Jekyll quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

To run the site locally, use the last command in the quickstart:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

We use the `minimal-mistakes` theme. Specifically, we use the `remote-theme` installation method, which is why the repo doesn't contain all of the html, css, and yaml files required for the theme. To learn more, read [this minimal-mistakes doc section](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#remote-theme-method). Note we are using a specific version of the theme, which can be found on `_config.yml`.
